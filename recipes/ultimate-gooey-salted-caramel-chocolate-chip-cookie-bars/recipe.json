    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup unsalted butter, softened",
        "1 cup brown sugar, packed",
        "1\/2 cup granulated sugar",
        "2 large eggs, room temperature",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "2 1\/4 cups all-purpose flour",
        "1 teaspoon baking soda",
        "1\/2 teaspoon salt",
        "1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips",
        "1 cup granulated sugar (for caramel)",
        "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed (for caramel)",
        "1\/2 cup heavy cream, at room temperature (for caramel)",
        "1 teaspoon fleur de sel, or to taste",
        "Additional fleur de sel, for sprinkling"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and prepare a 9x13 inch baking pan by lining it with parchment paper.",
        "In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.",
        "In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually incorporate the dry mixture into the wet ingredients. Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed.",
        "Pour half of the dough into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly. Bake for 15 minutes, or until just golden but not fully set.",
        "In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the sugar until it turns into a rich amber liquid. Add the cubed butter, whisking until melted. Carefully add the heavy cream, stirring continuously. Remove from heat and sprinkle in fleur de sel, adjusting to taste.",
        "Pour the warm salted caramel over the partially baked cookie layer. Drop spoonfuls of the remaining cookie dough over the caramel, leaving some exposed for a rustic look. Bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, until the top is set and lightly browned.",
        "Allow the dessert to cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes before lifting it out using the parchment overhang. Cut into bars with a sharp knife."
